# Developer Notes:
#### A bug on re-creating project:
On MacOS, if a project has been deleted then the new created project under the same name will not have the starter content. Since there is a folder not deleted by default that is under (~/Library/Preferences/Unreal\ Engine/). Delete the corresponding editor folder will solve the issue.

#### Using CLION with Unreal:
- For simplicity, you shall use Unreal 4.17 and find the `CLION Intergration` from marketplace on Epic Games.
- Or you may follow the instructions from [here](https://blog.jetbrains.com/clion/2016/10/clion-and-ue4/).
- It is said that this feature will come along with UE 4.19.
